GIMP scripts

	Normal Vector Selection
		Select areas with faces pointing in specified vector using world space or tangent normals
		
		Usefull texturing tool for 3D objects in 2D space
		This may come in handy for some other stuff... like quixel functionality on LINUX!!?! *GASP*
		
	Tangent AO(crevis from normals)
	
	World vector (Shows the downwards facing direction of a texture)
		
	Project data reader
		Reads data for a set of images regarding layer order, blend type, opacity and others...
		Designed to be used in tangent with a data writer. Together they can export projects from software
		such as Photoshop. (I have used Ps for years so naturaly this is a problem)
		
	PSD converter
		Rebuild layers into GIMP format and convert compatable effects such as adjustments and layer styles
		I have a lot of psd files laying around...
