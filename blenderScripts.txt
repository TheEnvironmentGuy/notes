Blender Scripts

	Render Pass analysis tool
		auto load passes
		setup composite structure according to file names
		Display the RGB levels
		Support for MRay, Cycles and BI passes
		
		Faster way to perform test render analysis
		Blenders compositor has all the neccisary tools to show relevant data
		
	Blend to ma
		Write vertex, uv and material data directly to .ma file
		This is a far more efficient method for rendering using Maya plugins than having to import/export .obj
		Will also maintain the outline higherarchy
		
		Update the model data in the ma file whine the blend is updated
			this is simular to doing project linking
