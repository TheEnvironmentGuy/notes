Coil Gun

	Calculate speed of projectile using audio recording
		User inputs distance from barrel to target
		Find db peaks by filtering all audio under threshold (this cleans up the audio so there is less chance of screwup)
		Get time stamp at peaks
		Run timestamps through algorithm
		Return meters per second
		
		This may be possible using Audacity API
		
	Statistics tool (Stores data from coilgun IC for statistical feedback in a spreadsheet procesor)
		Recieve data via USB device
		Input to spreadsheet
		
		We can use the code from my hardware driver to read from USB device
		Use the API for LibreOffice or choose to write dirrectly to a spreadsheet file.
		Be amazed
