Maya Scripts

	#Urgent
	Scene save script to maintain Windows->Linux compatibility
		Default view-port
		Delete history
		Turn off textures
		Remove unused nodes
		Close windows
	
	Auto Gamma
		Set non exr images too linear srgb
		Auto add gamma curve to all non file texture colour inputs
		Gamma settings in MRay
		
	EXR alpha extract (This is a work around for a MRay bug)
		Use the OpenEXR API to save out alpha channels from exr images
		Recode to 8bit(16?) tiff
		Connect the new alpha maps
		
	Transparent AO render layer (This is a work around for a material assignment error in Maya, as well as a time saver :)
		Methodically create layered ao shaders for objects with transparency into a render layer 
		
	Set-up tool (Makes migrating computers and error recovery much faster)
		Change settings of new scenes to reasonable values
		Load user preferences
		
	Asset re-importer (Fixes some bugs where an object wont render properly unless exported as obj and imported back)
		remove doubles
		delete history
		export selected object as obj
		import
		re-assign attributes
		
	Screenspace render agent (One less floating window)
		Render the current scene by overdrawing viewport
		
	Material Database (Dont wast time doing the same thing over and over again)
		Read from file and write shader network applied to selected objects
		Name shader nodes after name of applied object and function
		
	Auto node name tool
		Renames duplicate nodes in all node networks so they do not mach other networks
		
		Maya does not allow duplicate names however it does allow DAG nodes under different parents to have same name
		This can happen if you duplicate objects
		Will not stop render but it will cause error when assigning contribution maps
		Not sure if this is a bug but its very annoying
