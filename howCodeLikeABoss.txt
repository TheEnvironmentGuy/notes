Ten tips for bug tracking
	Try to reproduce the MINIMAL steps required to reproduce a bug
	Only person that can close a bug is the person who reported it, only he/she can be sure what they saw is fixed
	Use a bug tracker damm it!
	No reproduction steps, no fixed bug
	Always report exact version (ID) of bugged software
	Dont accept bug reports through any other chanel other than the official bug tracker
	If your a tester and having trouble getting devs to use tracker dont contact them. Just keep using the database and they will catch on eventually
	Dont alow people to add new feilds to the bug tracker, if you do it will be overun by pesky rodents
	If nobody is using the bug tracker start assigning bugs to members and use the tracker as an unimplemented features list
