Ramen (Multi source code moderator)

	Tool for conducting source updates for programs built from multiple seperate open source applications
	Pulls new commits from 3rd party sources and merges with trunk
	Focuses on specific sections of code, this means you can select the parts you need and discard the rest
	Allows the program to update itself automatically with 3rd party repos, saving the developers from manuely merging relivant pieces
	
	Would be used as a managment tool for Meld(Lasagna) development
	
	Its worth investigating some file commparison programs such as Kompare, Meld, Pretty Diff, KDiff3, Ediff...
