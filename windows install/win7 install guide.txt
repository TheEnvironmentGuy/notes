Intro:
	This is a general guide to installing win7 pro and setting it up.
	It assumes the user is already familiar with the general process
	and focuses more on what things need changed from the default settings
	
	This guide includes notes that are helpfull when setting up dual boot
	and provides refrence to other external reasources.

Creating an instalation USB:
	Note:
		This process will not work for XP, windows 8 or above.
		You will need a USB drive with at least 4Gb space.
	Process:
		Open CMD as administrator and use the following comands:
			diskpart
			list disk
			select <usb drive name as shown from 'list disk'>
			clean
			create partition primary
			select partition 1
			active
			format fs=ntfs
				#Note that this can take quite a while
			assign
			exit

		Now mount your win7 iso and use the following commands via CMD:
			<Drive letter of mounted iso>:
			cd boot
				#If you dont see the boot directory you have to go down a level
			bootsect.exe/nt60 <usb drive letter>:
			exit
		
		Open mount directory of iso:
			copy everything onto USB.

		Unmount USB and ISO

Installing:
	Note:
		On dual boot systems install windows before Linux. Doing otherwise
		will overwrite the GRUB bootloader.
		Take note of ROM sizes, windows installer will not show your device names.
		Use a USB2 port not 3. Vanila win7 does not have USB3 drivers untill
		after install.			
	Process:
		Boot from USB
		Go through install wizzard
			Use the advanced install option to set ROM device to use and format
			the disk.
		When installer reboots disconect the USB and set ROM as boot device
		Wait untill you get to desktop and your done.

Setup:
	Note:
		You must run system updates when your Linux ROMS are dissconected
		otherwise updates may fail and rollback takes a long time.
		At this point it is safe to install Linux for duel boot systems.
	process:
		Activate windows license
		reboot
		Run updates
		reboot
		Dissable UAC and turn off automatic updates.
		install GPU and other hardware drivers.
			#This includes drivers for reading Linux partitions
		reboot
		Run system update again
		You are now ready to install software
			#see the windows essential software list for details

	At this point it is safe to install Linux for duel boot systems.
