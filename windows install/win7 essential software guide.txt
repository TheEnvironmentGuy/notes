Intro:
	This guide provides a list of software which should be installed
	on any computer. It also provides some basic instructions 
	to the use of some key softwares.

	This guide is biast towards FOSS and cross platform solutions.
	It does not include software for specialized or use specific 
	purposes.  	

 	It is assumed you have followed the "win7 install guide" and
	are using a clean system.

	An internet connection is required

Getting started:
	Install chocolatey:
		Note:
			Chocolatey is CLI a package manager for windows that
			works much the same way as OSX, Linux or other Unix
			based systems. Throught the rest of this guide we will
			use this as a fast and efficient way to install apps.
		instalation:
			open CMD
			run the following code:
				@powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Command "iex ((new-object net.webclient).DownloadString('https://chocolatey.org/install.ps1'))" && SET PATH=%PATH%;%ALLUSERSPROFILE%\chocolatey\bin
		Using Chocolatey:
			use the word 'choco' in cmd followed by an argument
			such as 'search' or 'install'.
			Use comand 'choco -h' for full help file.
	
	Install Cygwin:
		Note:
			Cygwin is a terminal that brings Unix like comandline
			to the windows system. From this point on we will use
			it in place of the default CMD.

			Although uncommon some programs do not install, they
			simply run as is. In this case choco will place them
			inside 'C:\ProgramData\chocolatey\lib\'. You will need
			to make shortcuts yourself.
		Instalation:
			in the CMD use choco to find Cygwin.
				$choco search cygwin
			Find cygwin in the list and install.
				$choco install Cygwin x.x.x
	Add desktop shortcut to Cygwin if not alreadt there
